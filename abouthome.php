        	In year 1975, merely 50 Maheshwari families existed in Gale mandi area of Surat. Today about 5000, families are residing in different localities of the city.<br/><br/>

Currently there are approx 2000 big textile traders, 50 process houses, 150 chartered accountants and 30 doctors in Surat belong to our fast growing samaj.<br /><br/>
			By heroic efforts of Maheswari samaj people, a large Gigantic, spacious maheshwari samaj Bhawan with all modern amenities, was built up and brought into public use on 13-12-99. Today it is centre for various marriage and other cultural and social activities not only for maheshwari samaj but for other communities as well.<br /><br/>
			The foundation of Maheshwari School in Surat was laid on 9-6-01, over the decades, ennumerable students reaped benefits. At present, it is considered to be one of the best educational institutes providing CBSE system of education over 1400 students. The admission of student is on purely merit basis, without any donation.<br /><br/>
			Our samaj has made many foot print in service of humanity of "CHHAYDO", a social Organization, at civil hospital for service to poor and needy patients at very nominal charges.<br /><br/>


            In 1986 , The Maheshwari marriage bureau (MMB) Surat was established by our founder President Late Shri Shriniwasji Bharadia and Shri Ramavtarji Saboo as a pioneer secretary.<br /><br />
			Surat maheshwari samaj telephone directory was first pulished in year 1986.Thereafter,the editions of telephone directory were published in year 1987,1994,1998,2002,2004 and 2007.Its,8thedition is going to be published under guidance of present President of Bureau Shri Ramavtarji Saboo in current year 2010.<br /><br />
            The Bureau had organized first parichaysammelan in year- 1998,thereafter, 2nd ,3rd,4th,5th and 6th sammelans were organized in year 2000 ,2002 ,2003 ,2005 and 2007 respectively.<br /><br />
			Because of decreasing presence of girls candidates ,and lack of desired acceptiblity of participation in such sammelan's of our community, at present the marriage bureau has slowed the pace of parichaya samelan. At present the MMB has 61 members . From last 24 years , bureau is providing free services to society and at any given time atleast 2000 biodatas  of marriageable Boys & Girls , are available with bureau.<br /><br />
